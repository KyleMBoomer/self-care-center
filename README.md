# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I constructed a page that features an excellent stress-reliever in the form of a random advice generator. The user is able to select which type of advice they'd prefer, Affirmation or Mantra, and then click a "Receive Message" button. When that event occurs, their randomly generated advice appears in the box below the button box, filling their hearts and minds with the sweet essence of nirvana. 
  But that's not all! There is no end to the number of times the user may solicit advice from this wondrous contraption. It will generate endlessly for the user, though it may generate repeated advice from time to time. 

### Installation Instructions:

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
Simply click on the Self-Care-Center JPEG in this repo. 

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
To give context to my answer, I would like to state that I had no experience at all with HTML or CSS prior to this project. Most of the time I spent was on mastering the art of the flexbox, which was 6hrs or so. I spent approximately an hour building out the HTML, and then another hour or so refactoring it. The JS functions took me about 2hrs to concoct, and more than 4-5hrs to refactor. All in all, I spent around 13hrs on this project. I'm a Mod 1, Week 3 student at Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
My learning goal was to immerse myself into the details of CSS. Like I said before, the bulk of time I spent was with that software, and most of that time was sandbox time just experimenting with its flexibility. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and honiing my expertise with CSS. Obviously, HTML and JavaScript are a requisite to make any page function, so I enjoyed working with them, too. I built it all on my MacBook Pro. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
My greatest challenge also turned out to be my greatest win in this project. We were assigned to choose an extra feature beyong the Minimum Viable Product, which is what you'll see with this project. The reason I never made it to any extra features, given the time constraint (a weekend), was because I got hung up on a little detail involving my radio buttons (which I'd never heard of prior to this project, either). To wit:
  I was accessing them incorrectly in my DOM variables. It took me four hours of tinkering (and a desperate call to a friend of mine who is a Turing Alumnus) to discover that accessing those radio buttons by their parent div, and not by their ID, should break my code. Oh, how I wallowed after so much failure. But then, how I rejoiced when my page worked to perfection after that simple change. Such is the life of a dev, it seems.
